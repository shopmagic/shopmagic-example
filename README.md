# ShopMagic Example

Example ShopMagic plugin to show how to add custom events, filters, actions and placeholders.

## What's included?

We included 4 basic examples:

- Event: Order After Resend Email
  - Triggered after invoice/order details are manually resent to customer.
- Filter: Order - Customer Provided Note
  - Checks if the customer added a note to the order at the checkout.
- Action: Order Add Note
  - Add a customized note to the order (supports placeholders)
- Placeholder: Order Number (order.number)
  - Displays the formatted order numer (which in some cases can be different than the ID).

## Support

We think these examples will give you a very good overview of extending ShopMagic to your needs. The code is in most cases self explanatory and we also provided some inline comments to help you understand how these things work.

However, if you run into any issues or have questions, [please let us know](https://shopmagic.app/support/) and we will be happy to help.
